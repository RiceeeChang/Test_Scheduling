Test Scheduling for Core-based SoC
==================================

This project is our term project for class
*Design and Analysis of  Algorithms* in Spring Semester of 2013.
In this project, we aim to optimize test scheduling for System-on-Chip
testing. Detailed problem specification can be found
`here <http://cad_contest.ee.ncu.edu.tw/problem_e/default.html>`_.


Build the Project
-----------------

Prerequisite
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This project is implemented in C++ and complys with ISO C++03 Standard.
We did not use any external libraries or system calls. Hence, only a
C++ compiler is required. Besides, we provide a simple Makefile for
auto building via GNU g++ compiler and GNU Make.
